# Industrial-Attachment-Internship
Image Recognition project for detecting an is human or not human or blank, or the image is unclear or not aligned in the right place. This project is under industrial attachment in Teletalk BD.

## Description 
In this project we develop an image recognition system using [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)(CNN). 

Here we have used both [plain CNN Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-cnn-convolutional-neural-network 69fd626ee7d4#:~:text=CNN%20is%20a%20type%20of,features%20automatically%20for%20better%20classification.) and also [transfer learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/). 

In plain CNN model, we have used 5 convolution layers with 2 dense fully connected layers. 

In transfer learning, we have tried 7 pretrained models including: [VGG16](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vgg-16-cnn-model/), [Xception](https://keras.io/api/applications/xception/), [Inception Version 3](https://paperswithcode.com/method/inception-v3), [ResNet50](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-coding-a-resnet-in-keras-446d7ff84d33), [DenseNet121](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-densenet-121-with-tensorflow-edbc08a956d8), [DenseNet169](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/omz_models_model_densenet_169.html), [DenseNet201](https://keras.io/api/applications/densenet/)
